-   [echo chambers](https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2017/dec/04/echo-chambers-are-dangerous-we-must-try-to-break-free-of-our-online-bubbles)

it's worth noting that they're just the most applicable of the [huge list of cognitive biases we humans are subject to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)

## Task 15 - Investigating Political Parties and Informed Voting

In a democracy, being an informed voter is one of the most powerful roles you can play. But with dozens of political parties, conflicting claims, and complex issues, how do you decide who to vote for? It can be really tricky and there are very many examples of untruths:

| **Type**           | **Real-World Example**                                                                                     | **Explanation**                                                                                                   |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Misinformation** | During the 2016 EU Referendum, the Leave campaign‚Äôs "¬£350 million a week to the NHS" bus claim.            | Many people repeated the claim believing it was true, but it was misleading and based on gross figures, not net. |
| **Disinformation** | Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, e.g., fake Facebook accounts posing as Americans.           | Troll farms deliberately spread false stories to sow division and influence voter behaviour.                      |
| **Malinformation** | The 2016 leak of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign emails by WikiLeaks just before the U.S. election.              | The emails were real, but their release was timed and framed to damage her credibility and campaign.              |

## Special secret bonus:

Find me a good example of misinformation, format it like this and send it to me for use next session:

### Example of Misinformation:
Claim: "Drinking 8 glasses of water a day is necessary for optimal health."

### Explanation:
This statement is misinformation because it presents an oversimplified and outdated guideline. The "8 glasses of water a day" recommendation is a generalization that does not apply to everyone, as individual hydration needs depend on factors such as physical activity, climate, and overall health. More recent research suggests that water intake varies for each person and that hydration can come from both beverages and food sources (Institute of Medicine, 2004). Therefore, the claim misleads people by implying a one-size-fits-all solution without taking personal factors into account.
